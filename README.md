# Shortest-Job-First.cpp
 created a C++ program to implement the Shortest Job First (SJF) scheduling algorithm. The program takes user input for the number of processes, their Process ID, Arrival Time, and Burst Time. It then sorts the processes by arrival time and burst time to ensure shorter jobs execute first. The program calculates Completion Time (CT), Turnaround Time (TAT), and Waiting Time (WT) and displays the results in a tabular format, demonstrating how SJF scheduling optimizes execution by prioritizing shorter jobs.
